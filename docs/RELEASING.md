# Releasing NetPace

This document describes the release pipeline that builds and attaches downloadable artifacts to a GitHub Release when a semver tag is pushed.

## Release matrix

Each tag produces one archive per cell of the matrix below — currently 16 (4 Native AOT plus 12 non-AOT).

| Runtime ID | Self-contained | Framework-dependent | Native AOT |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| `win-x64` | `netpace-{ver}-win-x64-standalone.zip` | `netpace-{ver}-win-x64-net10.zip` | `netpace-{ver}-win-x64-aot.zip` |
| `win-arm64` | `netpace-{ver}-win-arm64-standalone.zip` | `netpace-{ver}-win-arm64-net10.zip` | `netpace-{ver}-win-arm64-aot.zip` |
| `linux-x64` | `netpace-{ver}-linux-x64-standalone.tar.gz` | `netpace-{ver}-linux-x64-net10.tar.gz` | `netpace-{ver}-linux-x64-aot.tar.gz` |
| `linux-arm64` | `netpace-{ver}-linux-arm64-standalone.tar.gz` | `netpace-{ver}-linux-arm64-net10.tar.gz` | `netpace-{ver}-linux-arm64-aot.tar.gz` |
| `osx-x64` | `netpace-{ver}-osx-x64-standalone.tar.gz` | `netpace-{ver}-osx-x64-net10.tar.gz` | _(out of scope)_ |
| `osx-arm64` | `netpace-{ver}-osx-arm64-standalone.tar.gz` | `netpace-{ver}-osx-arm64-net10.tar.gz` | _(out of scope)_ |

## Naming convention

`netpace-{version}-{runtime-id}-{variant}.{archive-format}`

- `version` — semver tag (e.g. `0.6.0`), no `v` prefix.
- `runtime-id` — .NET RID (`win-x64`, `linux-arm64`, …).
- `variant` — `standalone` (self-contained), `net10` (framework-dependent), or `aot` (native AOT).
- `archive-format` — `.zip` for Windows, `.tar.gz` everywhere else.

## Runner per RID

| RID | Runner | Rationale |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| All non-AOT entries | `ubuntu-latest` | Cross-compiles fine for non-AOT publishes; matches pre-feature behaviour. |
| `linux-x64-aot` | `ubuntu-latest` | Native x64 host — no cross-compile toolchain needed. |
| `linux-arm64-aot` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | Native ARM64 host — AOT cross-compilation is fragile, smoke test must run natively. GitHub-hosted ARM64 runners became free for public repos in January 2025. |
| `win-x64-aot` | `windows-latest` | Native x64 host — no cross-compile toolchain needed; `windows-latest` ships MSVC v143 and the Windows 11 SDK pre-installed. |
| `win-arm64-aot` | `windows-11-arm` | Native ARM64 host — AOT cross-compilation across architectures is fragile, smoke test must run natively. `windows-11-arm` runners became free for public repos in April 2025. |

Native AOT cannot be cross-compiled across operating systems — `dotnet publish` errors out with `Cross-OS native compilation is not supported`. Hence the per-RID native runners on both Linux and Windows.

## Smoke-test contract (AOT only)

Each AOT matrix entry runs two local-only commands against the freshly extracted archive on its native runner. Both MUST exit `0` for the matrix job to succeed; non-zero exit aborts the release.

```bash
./NetPace --version
./NetPace --help
```

The AOT binary is named `NetPace` (same as all other variants). On Windows the binary is `NetPace.exe`; on Linux/macOS it is `NetPace`.

## Archive-contents contract

Every release archive contains **exactly one entry** — the executable.

The "Create archive" workflow step uses a **whitelist** approach: it archives the binary by name (`NetPace.exe` on Windows, `NetPace` elsewhere) rather than zipping/tarring the entire publish directory. All variants are designed to produce a single binary — `-p:PublishSingleFile=true` for non-AOT, native AOT for the AOT variants — but the publish directory also contains toolchain by-products that must not ship to end users:

- `NetPace.Core.xml` — emitted because `NetPace.Core.csproj` sets `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>` for NuGet consumers.
- `NetPace.pdb` — emitted by the Windows linker for AOT builds regardless of `<DebugType>`.
- `NetPace.dbg` — emitted by the Linux AOT toolchain when `StripSymbols` is on (the default for Release).

Archiving by name keeps the release contract immune to whatever the next toolchain version decides to emit alongside the binary — no per-extension scrub logic to maintain.

A "Verify archive contents" step asserts the one-entry invariant on every archive before upload as a safety net (it also catches a silent build failure that produced no binary); non-zero exit aborts the release.

`<DebugType>embedded</DebugType>` in both `NetPace.Console.csproj` and `NetPace.Core.csproj` is still set as belt-and-braces — it embeds portable PDBs inside the assembly so the publish directory has no managed `.pdb` side files even for local `dotnet publish` invocations.

End-user CLI binaries don't ship symbols — maintainers reproduce locally with their own debug build. If customer crash-dump symbolication is ever needed, push symbols to a workflow artefact rather than into the user-facing archive.

## Size-assertion contract

The `attach-to-release` job validates two relative size invariants before attaching any archive to the release:

1. For every RID: `framework-dependent < self-contained` (existing pre-feature check).
2. For Linux x64/arm64 and Windows x64/arm64: `aot < self-contained`.

Either invariant failing fails the entire release job; no archives are attached.

## Build-time AOT gating

- `<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>` is declared in both `src/NetPace.Core/NetPace.Core.csproj` and `src/NetPace.Console/NetPace.Console.csproj`. This activates the AOT/trim analyzers continuously during `dotnet build` and surfaces `IL2026`/`IL2090`/`IL3050`/`IL3056` warnings at compile time, not just at publish time.
- AOT publishes set `PublishAot=true`, which activates a conditional `<WarningsAsErrors>IL2026;IL2090;IL3050;IL3056</WarningsAsErrors>` block in `NetPace.Console.csproj`. The workflow also passes `-p:InvariantGlobalization=true`. `-p:PublishSingleFile=true` is **not** passed for AOT — native AOT already produces a single executable.
- `<PublishAot>` is **never** set as a static property in any csproj. AOT is opt-in via the workflow's `-p:PublishAot=true` flag; dev-machine builds remain non-AOT.

## NuGet metadata

The `IsAotCompatible=true` property on `NetPace.Core.csproj` causes `dotnet pack` to emit `[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("IsTrimmable", "True")]` into the packaged DLL — the standard .NET marker NuGet uses to surface AOT compatibility to consumers. The `publish-nuget.yml` workflow is unchanged by this feature and continues to consume the property transparently.

## Conditional NuGet publish

`publish-nuget.yml` only packs and pushes `NetPace.Core` when `src/NetPace.Core/**` has changed between the current tag and the previous tag. On CLI-only tags (the common case — ~90% of releases), the workflow logs a skip message and exits successfully without invoking `dotnet pack` or `nuget push`.

**Why**: each tag would otherwise produce a new `NetPace.Core` version on nuget.org byte-equivalent to the previous one, eroding SemVer meaning for library consumers.

**Consequence**: `NetPace.Core` versions published to nuget.org may skip values (e.g. `0.5.0` → `0.7.0`) when intermediate tags were CLI-only. This is intentional — the published version always reflects a real Core change.

The GitHub Release / binary-attachment flow via `release-binaries.yml` is unaffected and ships every tag.

## SDK version pinning

The .NET SDK version is encoded in two places, both targeting **.NET 10 (LTS)**:

- **`global.json`** (repo root) pins `"version": "10.0.0"` with `"rollForward": "latestFeature"`, so local and CI builds resolve to the latest installed 10.0.x feature band — reproducible without hard-pinning a patch that may not be on every runner.
- **Each workflow** (`dotnet.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `publish-nuget.yml`, `release-binaries.yml`) sets `dotnet-version: 10.0.x` on `actions/setup-dotnet`, which installs a 10.0 SDK that `global.json` then honours.

When bumping the SDK major, update both places in lockstep.

## Release notes

Per-release "what changed" notes are **GitHub-auto-generated from the PRs merged since the last tag** — there is no `CHANGELOG.md` to maintain. The `NetPace.Core.csproj` `<PackageReleaseNotes>` property already points NuGet consumers to <https://github.com/FrankRay78/NetPace/releases>, so the auto-generated notes are the single source of truth for both CLI and library audiences. Edit the GitHub Release body manually only when a particular change deserves prose framing the auto-generated PR list can't supply.
